      <h1>Identity, Values, and Strengths Exploration</h1>
      <p>
        A question like “Who are you?” is truly dangerous territory! There’s
        always the temptation to say far too much, or far too little. How
        objective we can be about ourselves is unclear, and there’s plenty of
        room for self-indulgence with screeds of text about our personal
        philosophies or lives. With that in mind, I’ll aim to stick to the
        pertinent questions and the most salient answers to them.<br /><br />
        So, “Who am I?” Well, I’m a 33 year old pākehā from Tauranga. At about
        age 21 I was diagnosed with Chronic Fatigue, and that’s been a
        significant limitation until very recently. Prior to that diagnosis I
        was studying a degree in Software Engineering, and with that problem
        hopefully shelved I’m here to fast-track getting into the workforce.
        I’ve been writing code of one shape or form since I was about 14 or 15,
        for me Dev Academy is about formalizing that knowledge and filling in
        any gaps.
      <br />
      <h4>What are my ethics/values?</h4></hr>
      <p>
        The core tenet is probably “live and let live”. Or, more in my own
        vernacular: “don’t be an asshole”. Rules should exist to prevent us
        hurting, mistreating or exploiting the world or other people, we each
        have a personal responsibility to be tolerant, considerate, and
        cooperative. Temperance is a virtue.

      <h4>How did I come to this personal philosophy?</h4></hr>

      <p>
        Honestly, mostly from the gut. I suppose I subscribe somewhat to Stoic
        philosophy, but probably the most seminal text was Macchiavelli’s The
        Prince - supposedly an instructional treatise for the powerful back in
        16th century Italy. The ruthlessness of the leaders in the text almost
        always led to short-term gains, but the society they created inevitably
        led to them suffering bad ends. There was a certain appeal to their
        panache, but it wasn’t worth the world it created.

      <br />
      <h4>Have I been able to demonstrate this value structure in an ethical choice?</h4></hr>
      <p>
        Perhaps? The only one that comes to mind is from when I was at
        university - I briefly had an issue with communication between the
        university and Studylink that led Studylink to inaccurately conclude I
        was only a part-time student and terminate my weekly living cost
        payments. It took two weeks of back-and-forth to rectify, and during
        that time I was flat broke; having to borrow from a friend to pay rent.
        I don’t know if you’ve ever not eaten for a couple weeks (foolish I
        know, but too proud to ask for help there), but you start feeling less
        than excellent. I had an opportunity to pilfer some food, and chose not
        to. Honestly, it wasn’t even much of a choice. Perhaps all of five
        seconds, but there was that brief temptation. In the end it would have
        been wrong, and so I simply chose not to do it. It all worked out okay
        in the end, and with hindsight I’m glad I didn’t compromise my morals
        just to fill my belly.

      <h4>What strengths do I have? How will they help with learning?</h4></hr>
      <p>

        Well, every personality test I’ve ever been asked to do has agreed I’m
        level-headed, persistent, and a logical thinker. Of the three listed in
        the Student Handbook: DOPE thinks I’m an Owl, the strength finder has
        Judgement, Love of Learning, and Persistence in my top 10, and the BFI
        has Conscientiousness as the highest, and Negative Emotionality as the
        lowest. I think those are pretty self-explanatory as useful traits for
        learning. I’m satisfied to grind away at something, and am difficult to
        put off or be made upset.


      <h4>What limitations do I have?</h4></hr>

        <p>Well, the obvious one is a Chronic Fatigue diagnosis. Energy levels are
        naturally a thing I have to be cautious of, and ration out carefully. I
        also probably tend towards being happy chipping away at a thing rather
        than taking advantage of working collaboratively, but that’s something
        I’m happy to work on - it’s definitely something I’ll have to overcome
        in this industry!

        <h4>Finally, an example of when I’ve been trying to work productively with others and had issues/friction:</h4></hr>

        <p>I was doing some short-term contract work for a relative’s company,
        doing some repair work on a papermill during its annual shutdown. We’d
        been working 12 hour days, 7 days a week (plus maybe 90 mins travel),
        and on the last day just had to keep going until the job was finished.
        The work we were doing at that point was above our heads, and the
        co-worker I was working directly with was getting tired arms. He got
        snappish that it was taking too long and we should just half-ass the end
        and leave. He was also disgruntled that I was the one doing the
        finishing work despite being younger and less experienced. I disagreed
        with him - the quality of the work needed to be up-to-standard, and
        could fail structurally if it wasn’t performed properly. The impact of
        that failure would be minimal, but it didn’t sit right with me either
        way. To manage the situation I tried to impress on him the worst-case
        scenario: it could fail immediately, which would require us to start the
        section from scratch and be there for hours longer. He conceded my point
        (albeit with bad grace), and we finished what we had to do successfully.
        As an olive branch he offered me a ride home (faster than traveling with
        the bulk of the team), and I accepted… though he drove like a maniac and
        tail-gated the entire way home. I would say that my strategy was
        effective - I made sure not to try to pull ‘rank’ on him, and just
        pointed out that more haste might be less speed. If it were today I
        think it would be even more effective (purely due to being older, which
        seems to matter in that sort of work), but I probably would have
        politely refused his olive branch and let him burn off steam without me.
