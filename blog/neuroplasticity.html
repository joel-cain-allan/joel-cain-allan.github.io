      <h1>Neuroplasticity and the Growth Mindset</h1>

      <h4>Neuroplasticity</h4>
      <p>
        Neuroplasticity is the ability of the brain to physically adapt as a
        result of the brain’s own efforts.
        <br /><br />
        Understanding that the brain is capable of (and requires) altering its
        physical properties, is also an understanding that limitations are much
        less concrete than some pessimistic thought processes might suggest -
        working at something implies getting better at it, or at the very least
        enhancing the neural pathways involved in performing the practiced task.
        There are also benefits from ‘mental reps’, ie thinking through the
        steps of a physical action even if you don’t perform it. At a certain
        point actually performing a task leads to more measurable improvement
        than only mental reps, but mental reps still have inherent value.
        <br /><br />
        Taking all that into consideration, there are a few obvious conclusions
        to draw in terms of how one should approach learning:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li class="gapList">
          Positive thinking works (seen in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy). The
          act of thinking genuinely changes your neural pathways. Therefore
          thinking positively, and making positive associations with difficult
          workloads (ie thinking of something as a challenge rather than a
          burden) can lead to improved results.
        </li>
        <li class="gapList">
          Thinking about a task, visualization etc has genuine benefits to the
          learning process. This implies that there’s also value in immersion,
          even if too overwhelmed to get immediate benefit. This ties back into
          the value of positive thinking, and also being willing to chip away at
          a task.
        </li>
        <li class="gapList">
          Practice. Performing a task, even if only mentally, has measurable
          improvements in how you would perform that task in future. This should
          be apparent - think back to primary school when learning to count, or
          do arithmetic. Repetition leads to speed, accuracy, and confidence.
          Repetition leads to learning.
        </li>
        <li class="gapList">
          Translating a task into a more familiar shape can result in faster
          learning and completion rates. A relevant example is learning how to
          reshape a problem into a familiar problem - once you think of
          something as a graph problem, or a classic dynamic programming
          maximization it can be much easier to solve and understand.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <p>
        In addition to these methods, there are ways to improve your
        neuroplasticity. They mostly boil down to getting enough rest, or
        varying the types of tasks you are doing (as well as introducing new
        ones), but for the sake of completeness, here are a few selected
        examples:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li class="gapList">
          Get adequate sleep, and consider taking a nap. It’s no surprise that
          getting enough rest sets you up for a more productive day, and there
          is physical evidence that naps can encourage growth of Dendritic
          spines, tiny structures in your brain that can aid synaptic
          transmission and possibly even increase the number of possible
          connections between neurons. Rather technical for us poor laymen, but
          the message that napping can be useful ought to be clear.
        </li>
        <li class="gapList">
          Switching off. The brain needs rest just as much as it needs
          stimulation, and over-taxing the brain doesn’t result in improved
          outcomes.
        </li>
        <li class="gapList">
          Varying your tasks, and/or introducing new ones. There’s evidence that
          using less-used neural pathways in your motor cortex by using your
          non-dominant hand, balancing on one-leg, learning to juggle etc can
          have positive effects on your overall neuroplasticity. A similar
          process comes into play when learning a new language, listening (or
          playing) new music, practicing creativity with art.. thinking in new
          ways makes learning new things easier.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <h4>Growth Mindset</h4>
      <p>
        A growth mindset is, in simple-terms, a positive outlook/positive way of
        thinking that encourages embracing the idea of improvement, and
        rejecting the premise that your skills or abilities are entrenched or
        fixed. In understanding the concept of neuroplasticity, you must also
        accept that a growth mindset is desirable (and accurate) - we can
        literally physically change our own brains, which implies that our
        potentials are always much larger than we could imagine. To get the
        maximum benefit from neuroplasticity, we must first be open to the idea
        of growth, and willing to work towards it.
        <br /><br />
        Neuroplasticity and the Growth Mindset were familiar concept to me when
        I started this course (and if they weren’t, we did cover it in the prep
        material for Dev Academy), but it’s valuable to be reminded of them from
        time-to-time, and make it a conscious process for at least a little
        while. I hope that I've already fully integrated the idea of growth into
        my learning, but it doesn’t hurt to take a step back and evaluate if
        you’re taking full advantage of it. I intend to continue to set small
        goals and achieve them, and keep looking at the more distant goals with
        a ‘not yet’ attitude.
