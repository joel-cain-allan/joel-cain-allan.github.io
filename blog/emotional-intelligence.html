      <h1>Emotional Intelligence</h1>
      <h3>April Fools Day, 2024</h3>
      <h4>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h4>
      <p>
        In a nutshell, it's the ability to manage everything that
        <em>isn't</em> just intellectual. Human relationships, self-control,
        goal-setting, confidence etc. If life throws you a curve-ball, the way
        you handle it is often more emotional intelligence than IQ.
      </p>
      <p>
        Someone with high emotional intelligence is likely to be able to develop
        good friendships and coworker relationships, manage stress, take the
        initiative and be self-motivated, and serve in a leadership role. These
        are all very important skills for working in a team, especially if you
        aim to lead one. Sometimes these high emotional intelligence traits are
        referred to as Soft Skills, but soft is by no means a pejorative or
        diminutive - these skills are vital.
      </p>
      <p>
        Someone with high emotional intelligence is also more likely to be
        happy! EQ includes your handling of negative events, your ability to set
        realistic goals (and achieve them), and being able to be satisified with
        what you have achieved. High emotional intelligence is clearly desirable
        in the workplace (so much so that Dev Academy chooses to focus on it as
        a core skill), but it is at least as desirable in life in general. To
        steal a much-used phrase: 'Be the Best Version of You'.
      </p>
      <h4>What if I don't have high Emotional Intelligence?</h4>
      <p>
        Well, then you're in luck. Emotional Intelligence breaks down to a
        number of skills, and the thing with skills is that they are
        <em>skills</em>, not fixed qualities that you have no ability to change.
        You can choose to improve these skills, and expect to see real results.
      </p>
      <p>Dev Academy picks out three particular training methods:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Mindfulness Practice</li>
        <li>Conscious Listening</li>
        <li>Journaling</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        All three ultimately contribute to both better self-awareness, and
        awareness of others. Making informed, conscious choices is a critical
        step in developing good habits. First you gather information about your
        current state, look at areas that need improvement or refinement, and
        then make deliberate decisions and efforts to change those things. With
        time, such actions stop taking effort, and just become your new normal -
        a better, more rounded, more emotionally intelligent state.
