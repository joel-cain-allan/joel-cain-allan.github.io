      <h1>Te Whare Tapa Whā</h1>
      <h2>A foundation for wellbeing</h2>
      <h3>7 April 2024</h3>
      <p>
        I was first introduced to the idea of Te Whare Tapa Whā at the same time
        I was re-introduced to the idea of hygiene. We usually associate hygiene
        with self-cleanliness, but it really encompasses all habits we develop,
        and actions we take to ensure our own health and well-being. Te Whare
        Tapa Whā is a scaffold for those habits and actions, and has some nice
        and specific ideas about the aspects of wellbeing to target.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h4>Taha Tinana</h4>
      <p>Taha Tinana is about physical wellbeing, your body and taking good care of it by meeting its needs.
        <br>
        I've got a reasonably robust plan in place for Taha Tinana - having had Chronic Fatigue I had to develop behaviors that looked after myself, and also allowed myself as much latitude as possible. Mostly I target the big three: physical activity, nutrition, and rest.
        <ul>
          <li class="gapList">
            <strong>Rest</strong> means having discipline in when you sleep, having discipline in how long you sleep, and having discipline in allowing yourself to unwind. For me, this means I need about 9 hours of sleep. Bed at 10-10.30pm whenever possible, with a deliberate wind-down period where I might do a short puzzle, or some meditation. It also means not over-doing it on a daily basis - acknowledging that sometimes there's a trade-off between rest and physical activity, and that pacing is important.
          </li>
          <li class="gapList">
            <strong>Physical Activity</strong> means making sure that you don't rest <em>too</em> much. For me, I need daily activity to keep momentum, and some short-duration more demanding work once or twice a week. I go about that by taking my dog for a daily ~hour walk, doing daily chores etc to round out a base 10k steps, and then once or twice a week doing slightly more strenuous out-door chores like managing vegetation, cleaning the outside of the house etc.
          </li>
          <li class="gapList">
            <strong>Nutrition</strong> means eating well, regularly, and in smart portion sizes. This is something I can be a little anal about (though lately have been slack!), but my approach involves a healthy breakfast (yoghurt, muesli, fruit), a pre-prepared lunch (meal prep on Sundays), and a home-cooked dinner every night. 
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <br>
      <h4>Taha Hinengaro</h4>
      <p>Taha Hinengaro is about emotional, and mental wellbeing. It's about managing stress, how you feel, and generally looking after your mental health.
        <br>
        There's a lot of overlap between how I tackle this and how I tackle Taha Tinana, but here are the main ones:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li class="gapList">
          <strong>Space</strong> means having alone-time without demands on you, whether it's at home or outdoors. I make sure I get this in two ways - quiet time before bed, and getting outside with my dog.
        </li>
        <li class="gapList">
          <strong>Leisure time</strong> is making sure it's not all work and no play. I try to balance out the workload with some light reading, audiobooks, bit of TV, maybe playing a game... whatever I feel like. The point of leisure is to do what you want, and not be regimented. It might get put to the test in Bootcamp, but for now I'm not having trouble with making sure I'm getting some leisure time in.
        </li>
        <li class="gapList">
          <strong>Accepting imperfection</strong> is being human. I'm certainly not always going to get it perfect, and it would be ridiculous to think otherwise. I might try for perfection, but only so long as it does me no harm. There's a reason why we start with a minimum-viable-product before shooting for the stars.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <h4>Taha Wairua</h4>
      <p>Taha Wairua is about spiritual wellbeing. I'm not gonna lie, this is a tricky one for me, as it's not something I have ever felt a need for. I'm not a spiritual person in any way, shape, or form - the need for the spiritual is entirely absent. With that limitation in mind, I guess my plan here is to just be aware that it could potentially be a need at some point in time, and to not ignore it if it were to become one. </p>
      <br>
      <h4>Taha Whānau</h4>
      <p>Taha Whānau is about family wellbeing. It's about our connections with the people around us. My grandmother comes for a walk with me + my dog at least a couple times a week, plenty of family in the house, and I catch up with friends once a week. On the purely family side of whanāu my grandmother was the youngest of her mother's 18 children (yes, you read that correctly). Chances are half of you are my Whanāu even if you don't know it yet!</p>
      <br>
      <h4>Whenua</h4>
      <p>Whenua is about a connection with the land and our natural environment. This is probably less structured for me, but I get plenty of pleasant outside time with my dog every day. We tend to walk in various parks, around the nearby estuaries, on the beach by the surf... all places where you can really enjoy the land and environment around us. I have the privilege of living on a light and airy property, and my bedroom/office at one point was a sunroom or conservatory - there's a lot of glass and pretty of green outside to look at. I definitely feel surrounded by nature (even if I'm at war with some of these weeds!) </p>
