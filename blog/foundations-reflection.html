      <h2>That went quickly!</h2>
      <h3>15 April 2024</h3>
      <br />
      <h4>
        What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego
        due to the core learning?
      </h4>
      <p>
        Firstly, I learned that I'm more confident than I thought I was. I put
        myself out of my comfort zone by making sure to engage with the Dev
        Academy community, and aside from a flat joke or two it was all
        positive.
        <br />
        Secondly, I learned that I'm eager to get into the workforce. I
        <em>thought</em> I was, but spending time with some set tasks and goals
        has been very pleasant. Perhaps that's more from the tech side than
        core, but it feels valid to me.
        <br />
        Thirdly, I learned that I'm either I'm very bad about the core part of
        the curriculum, or I was already very aware of myself and my limitations
        prior to the beginnings of Foundations. Perhaps that sounds like a
        cop-out, but core focused on things I'd already thought about. I had
        plenty of time in the last decade for self-reflection, and looking for
        ways to improve lead to touching on a lot of this content. That's not a
        bad thing at all though - there's a degree of reassurance in knowing
        these have been questions that I'd already asked and answered.
      </p>
      <h4>
        What are the roles of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning
        and programming
      </h4>
      <p>
        Learning is a process that takes everyone different amounts of time.
        Empathy is valuable both for having patience with those who learn more
        slowly than you, and also in being willing to spend time helping them
        upskill. The same will be true in the workplace - everyone are going to
        be at slightly different levels, and we must hope that those more
        knowledgeable than ourselves will be willing to pass on the value of
        their experience. We must be self-aware enough to know the things we can
        do, and those we can't do yet... and be willing to put in the work on
        those 'not yet' skills. That also means having the self-awareness to
        know when you need help, and the willingness to ask for it.
      </p>
      <h4>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h4>
      <p>
        Probably the biggest surprise was how much of a focus it was during
        Foundations. I knew it couldn't possibly be 100% tech skills time, and
        that Dev Academy prides itself on focusing on human development and
        skills rather than purely 1s and 0s, but it was still a bigger part of
        the curriculum than I'd expected. With hindsight I should have expected
        it - there are some big concepts being taught on the tech side, and
        there's only so much a brain can take in over a week. Wise to mix up the
        focus a bit every week.
      </p>
      <h4>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h4>
      <p>
        I guess the toughest part is making sure to engage with it openly,
        without bias or prejudice, without preconception or reservation. This
        week in particular I feel a little flippant with some of these answers
        despite them being true and accurate - it feels like there's an
        expectation of something profound (and that hasn't materialized!). As a
        very definite introvert, and the only male in my family it can be a
        little tricky to be an open book, but I'm doing my best!
      </p>
      <h4>
        Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time
        focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
      </h4>
      <p>
        Well, it's certainly not a secret that Dev Academy views these skills as
        important (as do employers), and from what we've been told employers
        have seen it as a point of difference for Dev Academy graduates vs some
        of the other candidates they may see. It's also valuable in preparing
        people for the real work in bootcamp - the more comfortable you are with
        your learning style, stress-response etc the better you'll be able to
        handle the pressure and work with others.
      </p>
      <h4>
        Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of
        time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming
        instead? Justify your answer.
      </h4>
      <p>
        For me personally? I wouldn't say it was a waste of time, but it wasn't
        <em>exceptionally</em> useful for me either; but only because we're
        covering concepts I've already thought about. I'm on board with the
        importance of core skills along with tech skills, and participated in
        the core stuff happily. Frankly 'things I'm already familiar with' was
        the name of the game for Foundations, but that was not a surprise on the
        Tech side. It was a little surprising on the Core part of the
        curriculum, but I suppose I should have expected the possibility - not
        everyone who studies with Dev Academy is an old man like me!
