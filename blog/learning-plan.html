      <h4>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h4>


      <p>
        I’m looking to move into web development, not too many frills above and
        beyond that. In the long term something at least semi-remote would be
        nice, but step one is getting certified, and step two is getting
        relevant industry experience. Everything beyond that can wait.
      </p>

      <h4>
        A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
        learning?
      </h4>


      <p>
        I guess we’ll start with strengths. I’m a quick study as a general rule
        - I have a good memory, fast-processing, and am stubborn enough to keep
        grinding away at something until I have it down. I always did well in
        school, though when I was younger I tended to breeze by rather than
        worrying about putting the work in. Weaknesses… I’m not terribly good at
        sticking to a slower pace, and if forced to I tend to get bored and
        disinterested with the material. Also, as I have had (or still have?)
        chronic fatigue, energy levels may be problematic from time to time.
      </p>
    </br>
      <h4>
        What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see
        developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
      </h4>


      <p>
        Cooperation and collaboration would be the big two. I’m very comfortable
        working on my own, and will have to develop some good habits with
        splitting up the work, checking in with others in a team etc. On a
        broader, less work-focused level I guess being slightly more extroverted
        wouldn’t hurt.
      </p>
    </br>
      <h4>
        A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.
        This should include: An explanation of how you will manage yourself to
        work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and
        industry/community representatives What you will do when things are
        building up and starting to get to you
      </h4>

      <p>
        Not really sure what to put for this one. I do not intend, nor ever have
        intended, to do anything other than work both productively and safely
        with others. I’m not hotheaded, or prone to lash out, or anything like
        that. I commit to continue with the habits of a lifetime and try to
        treat others as I’d want to be treated. If we all do that then there
        will be no issues, but if any arise then I’m sure the Dev Academy staff
        will be able to mediate disputes. I’m not really a
        build-up-and-get-to-me sort of person unless I’m in desperate need of
        sleep, but if I were to feel that I was becoming overwhelmed or
        snappish, I’d take a break. Go for a walk, spend some time with my dog,
        take a power nap… whatever it takes to get my head right.
      </p>
    </br>
      <h4>
        A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
      </h4>
      <p>
        When it comes to technical help my tendency is to keep looking for the
        solution myself (hasn’t failed yet!), but I pledge to not be stubborn
        and ask for help if it would affect me or my team’s wellbeing in any
        way. As for well-being help, I happily commit to asking for help if I
        find that I need it.
      </p>
    </br>
      <h4>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h4>
      <p>
        Uhhhh, to facilitate? To answer questions, mediate problems, give some
        nudges or hints where needed. To ensure we have access to the education
        we’re seeking. So far you all seem to be living up to that with ease,
        and for many of you I’m sure you’ve been doing exactly that for years.
      </p>
    </br>
      <h4>
        Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are
        committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau
        commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.
      </h4>
      <p>
        Right now, no on-going commitments outside of Dev Academy - I organized
        for others to handle any day-time commitments in order to focus on this
        course fully. I do need a little time to take a family member to their
        GP on both the 9th and 10th of April, and if I can scrape some time to
        walk my dog in the morning a few days a week (just so other people don’t
        always have to do it on my behalf - he’s definitely getting walked
        regardless) that’d be nice. But aside from those appointments I’m
        flexible.
