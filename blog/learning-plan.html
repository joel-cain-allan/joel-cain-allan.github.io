      <h4>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h4>
      <p>
        It hasn't changed since we first did this learning plan. I want to move
        into the web development industry, and everything beyond that step
        doesn't matter for me yet. Before I can think too far ahead I need to
        see how well my body stands up the daily grind, and I'm not picky about
        where I start out. Long term I'd like to move up the ladder a bit, but
        that's about as far as ambition goes for now.
      </p>
      <h4>
        What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in
        Bootcamp?
      </h4>
      <p>
        Honestly zero change here, I nailed that in one - I'm a fast learner and
        have a leg-up on most students with how much time I've spent coding
        prior to Dev Academy, and the pitfall of that advantage will relate to
        managing boredom and impatience. So far so good!
      </p>
      <h4>
        What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will
        be?
      </h4>
      <p>
        Probably my home environment! There are a range of distractions from
        builders, to a young puppy, and now some unwell famnly members. There
        are a lot of people who rely on me for a number of things from day to
        day, as well as week to week. Managing those demands on my time and
        still making sure I have enough hours in the day for bootcamp and rest
        is going to be tough, but I'm up for the challenge.
      </p>
      <h4>
        What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see
        developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
      </h4>
      <p>
        Any and all teamwork and group dynamics problems. Ground up -
        communication, leadership skills, giving and receiving feedback, working
        as a team. It's been a long time since I've spent much time with team
        work, and those skills are beyond rusty. Every minute of it I can get is
        valuable.
      </p>
      <h4>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h4>
      <p>
        Point me in the right direction and let me go. Give useful feedback. No
        doubt we will all have questions from time to time, so availability to
        answer those in a timely manner, and probably keeping an eye on the
        whole class to make sure everyone is keeping up and coping with stress
        well (which may be harder to see from within the cohort).
      </p>
      <h4>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h4>
      <p>To thrive. I'm excited to get stuck in; can't wait.</p>
      <h4>A Commitment</h4>
      <p>
        I commit to continue managing myself, my approach to a greater workload,
        and work with others to the best of my abilities. My strategies for
        meeting that commitment remain the same as my initial ones: Be myself,
        and be prepared to step away or take a break if things are getting truly
        overwhelming.
      </p>

      <h2>The OG</h2>
      <h4>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h4>

      <p>
        I’m looking to move into web development, not too many frills above and
        beyond that. In the long term something at least semi-remote would be
        nice, but step one is getting certified, and step two is getting
        relevant industry experience. Everything beyond that can wait.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>
        A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
        learning?
      </h4>

      <p>
        I guess we’ll start with strengths. I’m a quick study as a general rule
        - I have a good memory, fast-processing, and am stubborn enough to keep
        grinding away at something until I have it down. I always did well in
        school, though when I was younger I tended to breeze by rather than
        worrying about putting the work in. Weaknesses… I’m not terribly good at
        sticking to a slower pace, and if forced to I tend to get bored and
        disinterested with the material. Also, as I have had (or still have?)
        chronic fatigue, energy levels may be problematic from time to time.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>
        What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see
        developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
      </h4>

      <p>
        Cooperation and collaboration would be the big two. I’m very comfortable
        working on my own, and will have to develop some good habits with
        splitting up the work, checking in with others in a team etc. On a
        broader, less work-focused level I guess being slightly more extroverted
        wouldn’t hurt.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>
        A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.
        This should include: An explanation of how you will manage yourself to
        work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and
        industry/community representatives What you will do when things are
        building up and starting to get to you
      </h4>

      <p>
        Not really sure what to put for this one. I do not intend, nor ever have
        intended, to do anything other than work both productively and safely
        with others. I’m not hotheaded, or prone to lash out, or anything like
        that. I commit to continue with the habits of a lifetime and try to
        treat others as I’d want to be treated. If we all do that then there
        will be no issues, but if any arise then I’m sure the Dev Academy staff
        will be able to mediate disputes. I’m not really a
        build-up-and-get-to-me sort of person unless I’m in desperate need of
        sleep, but if I were to feel that I was becoming overwhelmed or
        snappish, I’d take a break. Go for a walk, spend some time with my dog,
        take a power nap… whatever it takes to get my head right.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>
        A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
      </h4>
      <p>
        When it comes to technical help my tendency is to keep looking for the
        solution myself (hasn’t failed yet!), but I pledge to not be stubborn
        and ask for help if it would affect me or my team’s wellbeing in any
        way. As for well-being help, I happily commit to asking for help if I
        find that I need it.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h4>
      <p>
        Uhhhh, to facilitate? To answer questions, mediate problems, give some
        nudges or hints where needed. To ensure we have access to the education
        we’re seeking. So far you all seem to be living up to that with ease,
        and for many of you I’m sure you’ve been doing exactly that for years.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>
        Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are
        committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau
        commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.
      </h4>
      <p>
        Right now, no on-going commitments outside of Dev Academy - I organized
        for others to handle any day-time commitments in order to focus on this
        course fully. I do need a little time to take a family member to their
        GP on both the 9th and 10th of April, and if I can scrape some time to
        walk my dog in the morning a few days a week (just so other people don’t
        always have to do it on my behalf - he’s definitely getting walked
        regardless) that’d be nice. But aside from those appointments I’m
        flexible.
