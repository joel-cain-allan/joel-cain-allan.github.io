      <h1>Javascript Fundamentals</h1>
      <h2>Let's get some of the basics down</h2>
      <h3>2 April 2024</h3>
      <h4>What is JavaScript?</h4>
      <p>
        At it's core, JavaScript is a (and the name gives this away) Scripting
        language. It is ubiquitous on the client-side of the web, and according
        to wikipedia present in 99% of websites. <br /><br />At the most basic
        level, JavaScript is a way to tell webpages to display content
        dynamically, rather than being purely the equivalent of a poster put on
        a wall. You can see this in action on this blog - the dog image in the
        header is randomly selected between two options, and Javascript is what
        allows that selection (and the subsequent display of the selected
        image). The HTML and CSS represent the static content of a web-page, and
        generally speaking are what you actually see, while JavaScript (JS) is
        what does the actual heavy lifting.<br />
        A much-used analogy is one of a house. The blueprint of the house's
        framing, wall locations etc are HTML. The decorating choices, paint
        colours, fixture design etc are CSS. The plumbing, wiring, heating and
        appliances are JavaScript.
      </p>
      <hr />
      <h4>Okay, but how do you actually write it?</h4>
      <p>
        That's a very expansive question! Let's focus on some of the core
        concepts.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can break down the logic behind JavaScript (or any object-oriented
        language) into some smaller parts:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Objects</li>
        <li>Functions</li>
        <li>Control Flow</li>
      </ul>
      <hr />
      <h4>Objects</h4>
      <p>
        Objects are a way of representing information in a container. That
        sounds vague and tricky, but let me give you an example: <br /><br />
        <img src="/images/let-color-black.png" alt="let color: 'black'" />
        <br /><br />
        That piece of JavaScript represents declaring a variable (a type of
        object), with the <strong>let</strong> keyword, naming that variable
        <strong>favouriteColour</strong>, and giving it a value of
        <strong>"black"</strong>
        <br /><br />
        You could now call that <strong>favouriteColour</strong> variable
        elsewhere in your code, and retrieve that
        <strong>"black"</strong> value. That might not sound useful just yet,
        but it's one of the most core features of any programming language.
        <br />
        Objects go far beyond just simple single-layer variable declarations
        however, they can also represent <em>collections.</em> <br /><br />
        Consider the scenario where we have a group of people, and we want to
        record all of their favourite colours. Declaring a variable for each
        like<br /><br />
        <img
          src="/images/let-many-colours.png"
          alt="code example showing the declaration of multiple favourite colours: let tomsColour = 'blue', let sarashsColour='green', let gregsColour = 'white'"
        /><br /><br />
        <br />would be slow, tedious, and introduce a whole lot of variables
        into the codebase. We could, instead, store those variables inside a
        more complex object. <br /><br />
        <img
          src="/images/let-favourite-colours-object.png"
          alt="code example showing declaring multiple favourite colours as key-value-pairs in a JS object. favouriteColours.greg = 'white' etc"
        />
        <br /><br />
        We can add, change, or retrieve values from this new object with a key,
        in this case the person's name.
      </p>
      <hr />
      <h4>Arrays</h4>
      <p>
        An Array is a type of objec that is a collection - in this case
        essentially a list of un-keyed elements. Consider your sock drawer. Your
        socks probably don't have names, or other ways you refer to them, but
        you do have a collection of socks in there. In code, that sock drawer
        might look like this:
        <br /><br />
        <img
          src="/images/sock-drawer-array.png"
          alt="code example: let sockDrawer = ['sockPair1', 'sockPair2', 'oddSock1']"
        />
        <br /><br />
        Unlike objects, you can't fetch values with a key -
        <code>sockDrawer.sockPair2</code> is not going to achieve anything.
        Instead, for arrays, you fetch their values with an <em>index</em>.
        <br /><br />
        <img
          src="/images/sock-drawer-array-indexing.png"
          alt="code example: let socks = sockDrawer[1]"
        />
        <br />
        Note that indices do not start at 1! In Javascript, like most
        programming languages (I'm looking at you Lua), array index counts begin
        with 0. In the above code snippet index 1 actually refers to sockPair2.
      </p>
      <hr />
      <h4>Functions</h4>
      <p>
        Functions are the meat and potatoes of code, and introduce reusable
        logic. They are an encapsulated set of instructions that can accept
        parameters (ie user-defined objects or functions) and use them as part
        of their logic. This is very significant - without functions we would
        need to re-declare logic constantly (and our control flow would be
        disgusting, but that's a future topic).
        <br />
        <br />
        Consider a task like cooking a meal, there are many small parts of the
        recipe that must be performed, but many of those parts are actually
        basic, reusable skills that are used for all meals. Cutting vegetables,
        for instance, is always much the same process.
        <br /><br />
        <img
          src="/images/vegetable-functions.png"
          alt="code example showing other functions calling a 'cutVegetables(vegetable)' function"
        />
        <br /><br />
        In a world without functions, we'd instead have to define the logic for
        cutting vegetables every time!
      </p>
      <hr />
      <h4>Control Flow</h4>
      <p>
        The control flow is the order in which code is executed. The most
        straight-forward version of this is simply executing code from
        top-to-bottom. For anything but the most basic script, however, there
        will be wrinkles in that process. Calling a function causes the code in
        that function to be executed before continuing from the point it called
        that function, but called functions can call other functions too!
        <br /><br />See this flow example:
        <br />
        <br />
        <img
          src="/images/basic-flow.png"
          alt="code example setting up a control flow example; multiple functions logging out to console being called at different times"
        />
        <br /><br />
        Which causes the following output:
        <br /><br />
        <img
          src="/images/basic-flow-output.png"
          alt="output of above code example, showing the order in which code executes"
        />
        <br />
        <br />
        A consistent and function-driven flow is useful, but misses a core
        feature - what if we want to execute some code more than once? Well,
        there's where loops come in!
      </p>
      <hr />
      <h4>Loops</h4>
      <p>
        A loop allows code to be executed multiple times sequentially. Let's
        look at a basic example of a loop in action:
        <br />
        <br />
        <img
          src="/images/simple-loop.png"
          alt="code example: a basic loop incrementing the value i from 0 to 9, logging the value of i at each step"
        />
        <br />
        <br />
        This loop sets a variable with <code>let i = 0</code>, tells the loop to
        run until i is equal to 10 with <code>i &#60; 10</code>, and tells the
        loop to increase i by one after each loop with <code>i++</code>,
        (ensuring that the loop won't continue infinitely). On each iteration of
        the loop the console logs the value of i, first logging 0, then 1, then
        2 ... until finally logging 9. Then, when i meets the termination
        condition of being greater than 9 the loop terminates, and the control
        flow continues on in the same top-to-bottom manner
      </p>
      <hr />
      <h4>
        That's all well and good, but how does JS actually interact with the
        HTML and CSS?
      </h4>
      <p>
        This is where the DOM (Document Object Model) comes in.<br />
        <br />
        The DOM is a document that consists of a logical tree, from a root down
        many branches that terminate in nodes. Ultimately, a web-browser
        interprets this DOM to display a webpage to you. JavaScript can
        manipulate the DOM through a number of interfaces. For example, this
        page sets the dog face on the header by using the document interface:
        <br />
        <br />
        <img
          src="/images/dog-dom-snippet.png"
          alt="page source code showing an img element being created, having a random src selected for it, and then having its id, width and height set"
        />
        <br /><br />
        You can see that document.createElement is used to create an
        &#60;img&#62; HTML element, then that element's src, alt, id, width, and
        height properties are set, and after all that it's added to an existing
        span in the DOM like so:
        <br /><br />
        <img
          src="/images/append-child.png"
          alt="code: headerContentSpan.appendChild(headerImage)"
        />
        <br /><br />
