      <h1>Javascript Fundamentals</h1>
      <h2>Let's get some of the basics down</h2>
      <h3>2 April 2024</h3>
      <h4>What is JavaScript?</h4>
      <p>
        At it's core, JavaScript is a (and the name gives this away) Scripting
        language. It is ubiquitous on the client-side of the web, and according
        to wikipedia present in 99% of websites.
        <br /><br />At the most basic level, JavaScript is a way to tell
        webpages to display content dynamically, rather than being purely the
        equivalent of a poster put on a wall. You can see this in action on this
        blog - the dog image in the header is randomly selected between two
        options, and Javascript is what allows that selection (and the
        subsequent display of the selected image). The HTML and CSS represent
        the static content of a web-page, and generally speaking are what you
        actually see, while JavaScript (JS) is what does the actual heavy
        lifting.<br />
        A much-used analogy is one of a house. The blueprint of the house's
        framing, wall locations etc are HTML. The decorating choices, paint
        colours, fixture design etc are CSS. The plumbing, wiring, heating and
        appliances are JavaScript.
      </p>
      <br />
      <hr />
      <h4>Okay, but how do you actually write it?</h4>
      <p>
        That's a very expansive question! Let's focus on some of the core
        concepts.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can break down the logic behind JavaScript (or any object-oriented
        language) into some smaller parts:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Objects</li>
        <li>Functions</li>
        <li>Control Flow</li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <hr />
      <h4>Objects</h4>
      <p>
        Objects are a way of representing information in a container. That
        sounds vague and tricky, but let me give you an example: <br /><br />
      </p>

      <pre><code class="language-javascript">let favouriteColor = 'black'
        </code></pre>
      <p>
        That piece of JavaScript represents declaring a variable (a type of
        object), with the <strong>let</strong> keyword, naming that variable
        <strong>favouriteColour</strong>, and giving it a value of
        <strong>"black"</strong>
        <br /><br />
        You could now call that <strong>favouriteColour</strong> variable
        elsewhere in your code, and retrieve that
        <strong>"black"</strong> value. That might not sound useful just yet,
        but it's one of the most core features of any programming language.
        <br /><br />
      </p>
      <br /><br />
      <p>
        Objects go far beyond just simple single-layer variable declarations
        however, they can also represent <em>collections.</em> <br />
        Consider the scenario where we have a group of people, and we want to
        record all of their favourite colours. Declaring a variable for each
        like<br /><br />
      </p>

      <pre><code class="language-javascript">
let tomsColour = 'blue'
let gregsColour = 'white'
let sarahsColour= 'green'
        </code></pre>

      <p>
        would be slow, tedious, and introduce a whole lot of variables into the
        codebase. We could, instead, declare a more complex object to hold those
        values
      </p>

      <pre><code class='language-javascript'>
let favouriteColours = {}
      </code></pre>
      <p>
        And then can add, change, or retrieve values from this new object with a
        key, in this case the person's name.
      </p>
      <pre><code class='language-javascript'>
favouriteColours.greg = 'white'
favouriteColours.sarah = 'blue'
let color = favouriteColours.sarah 
//color is now equal to blue!
                </code></pre>
      <br />
      <div class="userTestSpace">
        <p>
          Try out setting a variable for yourself - the blue text below is equal
          to whatever you write in the little textbox. Change it to whatever you
          like!
        </p>
        <div id="userEnteredStringExampleOutput"></div>
        <input type="text" id="userEnteredStringExampleInput" value="hello!" />
      </div>
      <br />
      <hr />
      <h4>Arrays</h4>
      <p>
        An Array is a type of object that is a <em>collection</em>, or
        represents a group of multiple other objects. These elements don't have
        an easy way to reach them with a key like the above example. Why would
        you want to use a collection like this? Well, consider your sock drawer.
        Your socks probably don't have names, or other ways you refer to them,
        but you do have a collection of socks in there. In code, that sock
        drawer array might look like this:
      </p>

      <pre><code class="language-javascript">
let sockDrawer = ['sockPair1', 'sockPair2', 'looseSock']
        </code></pre>
      <p>
        Unlike objects, you can't fetch values with a key -
        <code>sockDrawer.sockPair2</code> is not going to achieve anything.
        Instead, for arrays, you fetch their values with an <em>index</em> -
        just the number representing which element they are in the array.
        However, there's something to keep in mind with this...
      </p>

      <pre><code class="language-javascript">
let socks = sockDrawer[1]
//socks is equal to the value 'sockPair2'!
        </code></pre>
      <p>
        In Javascript, like most programming languages (I'm looking at you
        Lua!), we begin counting with 0. So the first index in that array is a
        0, the second is 1, etc.
      </p>
      <br />
      <hr />
      <h4>Functions</h4>
      <p>
        Functions are the meat and potatoes of code, and introduce reusable
        logic. They are an encapsulated set of instructions that can accept
        parameters (ie user-defined objects or functions) and use them as part
        of their logic. This is very significant - without functions we would
        need to re-declare logic constantly (and our control flow would be
        disgusting, but that's a future topic).
        <br />
        <br />
        Consider a task like cooking a meal, there are many small parts of the
        recipe that must be performed, but many of those parts are actually
        basic, reusable skills that are used for all meals. Cutting vegetables,
        for instance, is always much the same process.
      </p>

      <pre><code class="language-javascript">
function makeCaramelizedOnions(){
  cutVegetables(onions)
  //other cooking logic here
}

function makeCarrotSticks(){
  cutVegetables(carrots)
}

function cutVegetables(vegetable){
  //logic for cutting a vegetable lives here!
}
        </code></pre>
      <p>
        In a world without functions, we'd instead have to redefine (or
        copy-paste) the logic for cutting vegetables every time!<br /><br />
        In addition to saving duplication, it lets us break up our code into
        smaller, more manageable and testable chunks.
      </p>
      <br />
      <hr />
      <h4>Control Flow</h4>
      <p>
        The control flow is the order in which code is executed. At the most
        basic level, code executes from top-to-bottom.<br />
        For anything but the most basic script, however, there will be wrinkles
        in that process - there will be loops (running the same piece of code
        multiple times), function calls (running a piece of code defined
        elsewhere), and it gets even more tricky once you start bringing in
        multiple threads.<br />
        When you calling a function, the flow moves to that function, the code
        defined in that function is executed, and then the control flow returns
        to where it was before calling that function. But functions can also
        call other functions (or even themselves!), so sometimes the control
        flow isn't straight-forward to understand.<br /><br />See this flow
        example:
      </p>

      <pre><code class="language-javascript">
console.log("a script")

function helloFunction(){
  console.log('hello')
}

function goodbyeFunction(){
  console.log('goodbye')
}

function helloAndGoodbyeFunction(){
  helloFunction()
  goodbyeFunction()
}

helloFunction()
goodbyeFunction()
helloFunction()
        </code></pre>
      <br />
      <br />
      <p>
        Can you guess what the order of things in the console log might look
        like?
        <br />
        Here's the executed order:
      </p>

      <pre><code class="language-javascript">
a script
hello
goodbye
hello
goodbye
hello
        </code></pre>
      <p>
        A consistent and function-driven flow is useful, but we've yet to cover
        a core feature - what if we want to execute some code more than once?
        Well, there's where loops come in!
      </p>
      <br />
      <hr />
      <h4>Loops</h4>
      <p>
        A loop allows code to be executed multiple times sequentially, often
        with slightly different parameters. Let's look at a basic example of a
        loop in action:
      </p>

      <pre><code>
for(let i = 0; i&lt;10; i++){
  console.log(i)
}
        </code></pre>
      <p>
        This loop sets a variable 'i' to the value 0 with
        <code>let i = 0</code>, tells the loop to run until i is equal to 10
        with <code>i &#60; 10</code>, and tells the loop to increase i by one
        after each loop with <code>i++</code>, (ensuring that the loop won't
        continue infinitely).<br /><br />
        On each iteration of the loop the console logs the value of i, first
        logging 0, then 1, then 2 ... until finally logging 9.<br />
        Then, when i meets the termination condition of being greater than 9 the
        loop terminates, and the control flow continues on as before it entered
        the loop, in the same top-to-bottom manner
      </p>
      <br />

      <h4>
        That's all well and good, but how does JS actually interact with the
        HTML and CSS?
      </h4>
      <p>
        This is where the DOM (Document Object Model) comes in.<br />
        <br />
        The DOM is a document that consists of a logical tree, from a root down
        many branches that terminate in nodes. This DOM represents the entirety
        of the web-page, and ultimately a web-browser interprets this DOM to
        display a webpage to you. <br />This DOM isn't entirely set in stone -
        JavaScript can manipulate the DOM through a number of interfaces. For
        example, this page sets the dog face on the header by using the document
        interface:
      </p>

      <pre><code class="language-javascript">
let headerImage = document.createElement('img')

if (getRandomInt(2) &gt; 0) {
  headerImage.src = '/images/archie-head-big.png'
  headerImage.alt = 'apprehensive black and tan dog face'
} else {
  headerImage.src = '/images/cindy-head-big.png'
  headerImage.alt = 'cheeky fluffy yellow dog face'
}

headerImage.id = 'dog-head'
headerImage.width = '150'
headerImage.height = '150'
        </code></pre>
      <p>
        The conditional (if, else) might be confusing, but hopefully you can see
        that document.createElement is used to create an &#60;img&#62; HTML
        element named headerImage, and then that element's src, alt, id, width,
        and height properties are set.<br />Finally, that headerImage is added
        to an existing span in the DOM like so:
      </p>

      <pre><code class="language-javascript">
headerContentSpan.appendChild(headerimage)
        </code></pre>
      <br /><br />
      <p>Hopefully you learned something new!</p>
