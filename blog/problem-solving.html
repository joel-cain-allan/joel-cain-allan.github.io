      <h4>A Problem I Was Once Stuck On</h4>
      <p>
        About a week ago I was working on a side project, moving from a
        placeholder data layer to a SQLite database. If that sounds confusing,
        basically I was building a more robust way to properly save (and
        retrieve) data. This side project was a Windows desktop application,
        rather than a website, and to cut a corner I decided to use Entity
        Framework Core (an ORM or Object-relational mapper) to design the
        database for me from my existing code. If you don't know what an ORM is,
        it's basically a piece of code that it builds connections between a
        database and data you might want to save or read within your own code.
        <br /><br />I wasn't terribly familiar with EF Core, so when database
        calls started throwing some errors, I had to investigate quite closely
        to understand the cause. The errors were 'outside' of my code, being
        thrown by the framework, and unhelpfully had a completely empty error
        message - this made the problem worse, as Unit Testing (little tests
        designed to check small pieces of functionality), were unable to give me
        useful data beyond the fact that it wasn't working.
        <br />
        To solve the problem I dug through documentation without a lot of luck,
        and ultimately deduced the problem by looking closely at which tests
        were failing vs which were succeeding. I also wrote some additional
        tests to isolate the exact database calls that were failing.
        <br /><br />
        It turns out that although EF Core tracks the entities (think: objects)
        that you add or modify, it isn't good at handling nested objects by
        itself. For instance, my problem was that it was incorrectly flagging
        some data in a nested object as having changed, and then not seeing the
        database change when it tried to persist those changes.
        <br /><br />
        Manually adding some logic to replace the not-actually-changed objects
        with fresh ones straight from the database made EF Core work much more
        smoothly. I still wonder if I would have been better off just building
        the database tables myself, but I learned a lot about how EF Core works
        at least!

      <h4>A Time I Elegantly Solved a Problem</h4>
      <p>
        This one is going to be a little technical, but bear with me here.
        <br />
        <br />
        Back when Wordle was a real fad, I amused myself with writing a twitter
        bot that solved the daily wordle. When other 'dle' games started
        appearing, I wrote solvers for some of those two. The one I'm going to
        talk about is <a href="https://squaredle.app/">Squaredle</a>
        <br /><br />
        For the un-initiated, Squaredle is a bit like a wordfind. There's a grid
        of letters, and a number of (unknown) words you must find within it.
        Unlike a word find you aren't limited to sticking to moving in only a
        single direction; for any given letter in Squaredle, you may select any
        of the letters around it as the next letter in your solution/guess. For
        example, on this grid you could select <strong>naive</strong>:
      </p>
      <br />
      <img
        src="/images/squaredle.png"
        alt="a squaredle grid with the word naive outlined"
      />
      <p>
        This presented a problem: how would I efficiently find words in the
        grid?
        <br />
        Modelling the grid itself was fine - I could treat it as a
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(abstract_data_type)"
          >graph</a
        >, but I still had a problem in dealing with what exactly IS a word, and
        how will I actually search this graph for words? My first thought was to
        take a copy of the scrabble dictionary, and then search it in a the most
        efficient way possible. There was a problem, however. Dictionaries are
        big! The time involved in reading through an entire dictionary and
        checking for each word wasn't the sort of solution I would be happy
        with.
        <br />
        After a little thought, I decided to tackle this problem with a tricky
        type of data-structure - a
        <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterministic_acyclic_finite_state_automaton"
          >DAWG</a
        >, which is both a type of graph, and also as small as possible from a
        memory standpoint. The graph properties made it very searchable - I
        could heavily limit the number of words that needed checking, and the
        samll size of the dictionary file fit some of my other requirements. A
        perfect solution!
        <br />
        This might not be true for all of you, but for me there is very little
        as satisfying as finding an elegant, correct solution for a problem.
        It's a shot of adrenaline straight to the ego. I definitely learned the
        value of looking outside-the-box for solutions to problems, and enjoyed
        reaping the rewards.

      <h4>Some Reflection Time</h4>
      <p>
        There are a number of problem solving techniques and processes, and
        we're going to go through some and how I feel about them rapid-fire:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li class="gapList">
          Pseudocode. The act of writing it out in a language-agnostic fashion
          to get your head around a problem. It's definitely something I use
          from time to time with complex problems, and am confident that I can
          use it when necessary (although I avoid using it when it isn't)
        </li>
        <li class="gapList">
          Trying Something. My personal favourite. I'm a tinkerer, I like to
          look at cause and effect and work out the solution myself whenever
          possible. Right in my wheelhouse
        </li>
        <li class="gapList">
          Rubber Ducky. Trying something, but with a little rubber friend. I
          usually talk to my dog rather than a duck, but verbalizing the problem
          definitely gets some other parts of the brain working on it too. If
          you haven't tried it, you should - it's shockingly helpful!
        </li>
        <li class="gapList">
          Reading Error Messages. The first place to start whenever you get an
          exception. Chances are it's going to point you in the right direction,
          but even if it isn't immediately helpful it's a critical part of bug
          hunting.
        </li>
        <li class="gapList">
          Console.Logging. Great way of gathering information, definitely
          something I use all the time when writing small methods that I don't
          intend to unit-test right away. Saves a lot of time in the long run
        </li>
        <li class="gapList">
          Googling. Google is absolutely your friend. If you can't find it in
          StackOverflow, the docs, or someone's random blog chances are you're
          asking the wrong questions.
        </li>
        <li class="gapList">
          Asking your peers for help. Very useful if you're working on something
          they understand well. Not something to be shy of doing, but I
          personally work through the other problem-solving methods first.
        </li>
        <li class="gapList">
          Asking coaches for help. Same deal as asking peers (but they're more
          likely to be experts on it). Definitely one I'm comfortable doing if
          my own efforts come up dry
        </li>
        <li class="gapList">
          Improving your process with reflection. Taking some time to think
          about your own problem solving techniques is definitely beneficial for
          future problem solving. I'm very comfortable with the self-analysis
          that requires, and it's definitely something I frequently work on.
          We're all ultimately problem solvers.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <h4>What About a Time You Were Reluctant to Ask for Help?</h4>
      <p>
        Honestly, not something I have trouble with. I'm very comfortable with
        being imperfect, and I'm not afraid to ask for guidance when it's
        needed. When it came to actual life-stuff I was always reluctant to ask
        for help when I was in my teens, but now in my thirties I'm not so
        afraid. I'm probably still too slow to ask for help, but only because
        I'm confident I can find a solution. If I feel I can't, be sure I'm
        going to ask!
